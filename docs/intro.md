# Introduction

Welcome to the Flood CamML documentation! :books:

The Flood CamML app is an easily customizable web app for crowd-sourcing webcam image labelling and deploying a machine learning (ML) image classification model. We use it for label roadway flooding, but you can use it for any webcam or image classification model!

Here you will find a **tutorial to create your own CamML app** and more **details about the how Flood CamML works**.

## Example

To see a CamML in action, see the [NC12 Flood CamML](https://nc12.floodcamml.org) and its [associated blog post](/blog/nc12)
