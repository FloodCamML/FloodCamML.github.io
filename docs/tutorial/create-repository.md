# Creating a repository

This page will walk through how to create a repository using a Flood CamML code template and customize it for your project.

## Flood CamML code templates

GitHub provides a special type of repository called a "code template" that allows users to easily copy the current state of a respository.

The Flood CamML project offers **two** code templates that vary based on the deployment strategy:
- Google Cloud Run [code template](https://github.com/FloodCamML/FloodCamML_cloudrun)
- shinyapps.io [code template](https://github.com/FloodCamML/FloodCamML_shinyapps)

## Create a repository

Using the links above, navigate to the code template of your choice. Once on the code template page, click the green button in the upper right labeled `Use this template`.

This button loads a page that will let you create a new repository using the code template. Name the new repository, add a description, and designate as a public or private repository.

## Clone to your machine

Open GitHub Desktop, click **File > Clone Repository**. Search for and select your newly created repository, then click the **Clone** button to download the repo to your computer.

Congrats! ðŸŽ‰ You know have all the code necessary to run a CamML app on your computer. 

We'll get to customizing the app later - next step is to set up the necessary Google services.
