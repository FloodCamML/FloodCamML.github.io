# Getting Started

To make your own CamML app, you need to be able to use the following programs:

## GitHub 

We will be using GitHub Desktop in this tutorial to work off of a code template. This will involve cloning a repository to your local computer so you can customize it.

#### Resources

- [Download GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- [GitHub basic tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) 


## RStudio

RStudio allows us to easily edit the code template and view our app locally. We can also use RStudio to deploy our app to [shinyapps.io](https://shinyapps.io). 

#### Resources

- [Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)
- [Get started with Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/)

## Google account 

CamML makes use of a Google Account to access Google Sheets, Google Drive, and change API permissions. You can use your personal Google account or make a new one for your project/business.

#### Resources
- [Create a Google Account](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp)

## Google Cloud Run OR shinyapps.io

We have instructions for deploying CamML on Google Cloud Run (a container hosting service) and shinyapps.io (RStudio shiny app hosting). A CamML container should work on other webservices that support containers.

#### Resources
- [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

## Docker

Docker creates containers, which are portable images that include an operating system and all necessary dependencies to run specific code. We will be using Docker Desktop to package up our shiny app for deployment.
