# The NC12 Flood CamML

Meet the [NC12 Flood CamML](https://www.floodcamml.org)!

The NC12 Flood CamML is a web application we created to **automatically detect roadway flooding** and **collect flood classifications from the community** along North Carolina Highway 12 (NC12).

NC12 provides access to the Outer Banks, a chain of low-lying barrier
islands. Segments of NC12 are highly vulnerable to both storm and high-tide impacts, and when flooded,
isolate communities from the mainland. The NC Department of Transportation maintains a series of webcams
along NC12, which we utilize here!

## NC12 Flood CamML Instructions

Please help us validate our ML models to identify flooded roadways!

 - *What do we mean by flooded?* -- Images should be labeled *"flooded"* if several
inches or more of water is on the roadway (typically recognizable by a sheen). Wet roadways should 
be classified as "not flooded".   

 - *What if you are not sure if the roadway is flooded, or if the image is blurred?* -- If you cannot
see the roadway in an image, or if you are not sure if flood waters are in the roadway or off to the
side, classify the image as "not sure"
