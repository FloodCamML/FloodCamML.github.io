# About Flood CamML 

Flood CamML is an open source project funded by the NSF Coastlines and People program, and was 
completed over ~72 hours by a group of awesome scientists from across the country. 

## Our mission

Develop a machine learning (ML) algorithm that can detect from a single image (NCDOT Camera Feed) 
whether or not a roadway is flooded.

## Why did we make Flood CamML?

As scientists, we are interested in *how often* coastal roadways -- and the people that depend on 
these roadways -- are impacted by shallow (nuisance) flooding or ponding.
                     
It is *easy* for a human to look at a traffic camera and recognize whether a roadway is flooded, but
who has all day to look at web cameras? 

## Our questions

- Can we train a machine to detect flooding? 
- Or can the machine train itself to detect flooding 
given enough images? 
- Can we create an avenue for citizen science participation to foster community
engagement with science and improve model predictions?
